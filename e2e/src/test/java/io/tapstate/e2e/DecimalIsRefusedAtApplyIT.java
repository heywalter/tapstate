/**
 * The witness that computing on an exact fixed-point column is refused while the author is still
 * writing, against a real column whose type a real connector reported.
 *
 * <p>The type has to come from a real database. A synthetic source declares every column as text, so a
 * specification written against one cannot tell a refusal of decimal arithmetic from a refusal of
 * everything - the discriminating fact is that this column is a decimal and the connector said so.
 *
 * <p>Two assertions, because either alone is satisfied by an outcome this test exists to exclude.
 * Asserting only that the apply failed is satisfied by any failure at all, including a connector that
 * would not load; asserting only the code leaves "refused, having already filed the pipeline"
 * indistinguishable from a clean refusal, and a half-applied workspace is the state an author would
 * then have to unpick by hand.
 *
 * <p>Discovery runs before the apply, not after it, which is the order the obligation on reading a row
 * field imposes. So the refusal here cannot be the absent-schema refusal wearing a different name: the
 * schema is present, and the only thing left to object to is the type in it.
 *
 * <p>Its companion is {@link LosslessNumericTypeIsAcceptedIT}, and neither is complete without the
 * other. A product that refused every numeric expression would pass this one.
 *
 * <p>Gated on Docker and on a directory of real connector jars, the same as the other real-connector
 * witnesses. Run it with:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   mvn -pl e2e -am verify -Dapi.version=1.44 \
 *     -Dtapstate.e2e.connectors-dir=/path/to/connectors
 * </pre>
