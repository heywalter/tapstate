 *
 * <p>{@code pipeline} references a product {@code .tap.yml} by path and is read with the product's
 * own parser, so a specification cannot drift from the DSL it exercises.

 * @param setup the connection-provisioning facet: the bootstrap a real endpoint needs before a
 *     pipeline can reference it at all
 * @param seed the initial data laid down before the first step runs
