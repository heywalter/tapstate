/**
 * Where the published examples live, and how to find them.
 *
 * <p>One sweep, and no way to name an example by hand. The executor that runs the examples and the gate
 * that parses and validates them both enumerate from here, so the published set and the exercised set
 * are the same set by construction. Were either able to name one directly, the two would drift in
 * silence - each green against a different subset, and an example belonging to neither.
 *
 * <p>An example is a directory rather than a lone document: a specification names resources by
 * filename and is loaded against a workspace, so the specification and the resources it names are one
 * unit and travel together. The workspace is therefore the specification's own parent.
