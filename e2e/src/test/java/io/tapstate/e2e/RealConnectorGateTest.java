/**
 * The gate decides what missing real connector jars mean, and the answer turns on intent, the same

 * real connectors must never report green having aborted on a typo'd or half-populated connectors
 * directory - a skip there is a broken gate wearing a passing badge. Naming no directory at all is the
 * ordinary developer default and aborts; naming one whose jars do not resolve is a gate the operator
 * meant to run and fails.
