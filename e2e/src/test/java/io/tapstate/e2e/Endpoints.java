/**
 * The endpoints a specification lays data on and reads data from, reached with a driver of the
 * harness's own rather than through the product.
 *
 * <p>This is the one thing the harness must not delegate: a count taken from the product's own record
 * of what it wrote would agree with the product by construction, and would keep agreeing while the
 * target stayed empty. Every implementation of this interface is therefore a second, independent
 * reader of a store the product also reaches - and owes that store's format nothing but agreement.
 *
 * <p>One implementation per kind of store, chosen by the connector the resource names: a specification
 * addresses a table as {@code <resourceId>.<table>}, the resource says which connector reaches it, and
 * that is what decides which driver reads it. The {@code uri} setting the resource carries is passed
 * through as written, so what the harness dials is what the product was given.
