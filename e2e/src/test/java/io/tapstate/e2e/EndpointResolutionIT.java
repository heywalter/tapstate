/**
 * Holds the harness to the one promise every count in every specification rests on: that an alias reaches
 * the endpoint its own resource names, and no other.
 *
 * <p>A specification says {@code count: { tgt_file.orders: 3 }} and trusts the harness to know where
 * {@code tgt_file} lives. The harness learns that by reading the resource it applied. Were that lookup to
 * collapse two aliases onto one address, a specification could count the rows the harness itself seeded
 * into the source and pass without a single row having crossed the product - every await green, the
 * product never consulted. That is the one way a whole suite of specifications can be wrong at once.
 *
 * <p>So it is checked here rather than at the end of a pipeline run. The lookup is one piece of harness
 * code shared by every specification, so a run per example proves the same thing repeatedly and proves it
 * late; and a run that never started a pipeline has no count to disagree with, which is exactly when a
 * wrong address would go unnoticed. Two aliases, two directories this test chose, two different row
 * counts, and no pipeline at all: the seeds are read back by path, not by alias, so a lookup that sent
 * both to one directory cannot survive.
 *
 * <p>One tier, deliberately. The lookup runs entirely in the harness before the product is dialled, so it
 * cannot differ by how the server was launched.
