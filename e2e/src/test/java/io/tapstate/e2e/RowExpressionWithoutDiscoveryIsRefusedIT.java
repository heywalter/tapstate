/**
 * The witness that reading a row field obliges the author to have discovered the source first, and
 * that a pipeline reading no row field carries no such obligation.
 *
 * <p>Both halves are here because either alone permits an outcome this test exists to exclude. The
 * refusal alone is satisfied by a product that demands discovery of everything, which would make the
 * obligation a tax on pipelines it cannot possibly protect; the acceptance alone is satisfied by a
 * product that demands discovery of nothing, which is the hole the obligation was written to close.
 * Together they pin the boundary at the one place it belongs: whether the expression reads the row.
 *
 * <p>The two pipelines differ in their expression and nothing else - same source, same target, same
 * shape, applied against the same undiscovered source. So a refusal that arrived for any other reason
 * would take the second half down with it rather than leaving a green half to explain it away.
 *
 * <p>The refusal is asserted by its code and by the server's own artifact listing, not by the code
 * alone: "refused, having already filed half the batch" and a clean refusal answer the same code, and
 * only the listing tells them apart. The listing is read over every artifact the batch submitted rather
 * than the pipeline alone: the source and target are the ones written first, so a batch that filed half
 * of itself is half-filed in exactly the artifacts a pipeline-only assertion never looks at.
 *
 * <p>Runs on the harness's own connector, so it needs Docker for the store and nothing else. That is
 * deliberate. The obligation's subject is whether an expression reads a row, which no real database is
 * required to demonstrate - and a witness that runs in an ordinary build guards it on every change,
 * where one gated on real connector jars would only be consulted at night.
