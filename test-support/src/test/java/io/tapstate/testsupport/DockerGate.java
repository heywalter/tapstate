/**
 * Decides what an unavailable Docker daemon means for a test that needs real containers.
 *
 * <p>The usual annotation for this ({@code @Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)}) answers
 * "skip" everywhere, which is wrong in exactly one place that matters: a suite whose reason to exist
 * is running against the real thing would report a green build in CI having run nothing. So the answer
 * is split by environment - a developer without Docker gets an honest abort, CI without Docker gets a
 * failure.
 *
 * <p>Usable two ways. A suite that owns its container lifecycle calls {@link #require()} from
 * {@code @BeforeAll}. A suite that lets the Testcontainers extension start static containers cannot:
 * that extension runs before any {@code @BeforeAll} method, so it would hit the missing daemon first
 * and raise its own error before this class was ever consulted. Those suites use
 * {@link RequiresDocker}, which registers this class as an execution condition - and conditions are
 * evaluated before any callback, whatever order the annotations were written in.
 *
 * <p>The skip is a disabled condition rather than an aborted one on purpose. Both keep a Docker-less
 * developer machine green, but an aborted container is reported as nothing at all: the suite vanishes
 * from the run instead of appearing in the skipped count. Trading a visible "skipped" for silence is
 * the wrong direction for a gate whose entire subject is tests that seem to have run.
