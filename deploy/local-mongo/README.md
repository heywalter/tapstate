# Local MongoDB replica-set

A single-node MongoDB replica-set for local development, so the server can be run against a real
store on a developer machine.

A replica-set (not a standalone) is required: the checkpoint compare-and-swap runs inside a
multi-document transaction, which MongoDB only offers on a replica-set.

## Usage

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/local-mongo/docker-compose.yml up -d
# wait until healthy:
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' tapstate-mongo-rs
```

The set is reachable at:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017/tapstate?replicaSet=rs0
```

which is the server's default store URI. Tear it down with:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/local-mongo/docker-compose.yml down        # keep data
docker compose -f deploy/local-mongo/docker-compose.yml down -v     # drop data
```

This plaintext set is for local development convenience. **TLS is opt-in**: the server connects to
this set over plaintext with no extra flag (it is the server's default store URI). For anything
resembling a real run, use the TLS set below.

## TLS set (opt-in TLS path)

TLS is opt-in: the server connects in plaintext unless the URI asks for TLS with `ssl=true`.
`docker-compose.tls.yml` runs the same single-node replica-set with `requireTLS`, presenting a
self-signed chain the client trusts explicitly — the local development analogue of a real TLS store.

```sh
deploy/local-mongo/tls/gen-certs.sh                                     # once: self-signed CN=localhost chain
docker compose -f deploy/local-mongo/docker-compose.tls.yml up -d
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' tapstate-mongo-rs-tls  # wait until healthy
```

Point the server at it — ask for TLS in the URI with `ssl=true`, and trust the self-signed CA via
`tls-ca-file`:

```
tapstate.store.mongo.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/tapstate?replicaSet=rs0&ssl=true
tapstate.store.mongo.tls-ca-file=deploy/local-mongo/tls/ca.pem
```

The generated `ca.pem`/`server.pem` are git-ignored — a private key never belongs in the repo, so each
developer generates their own. Tear down with `down` / `down -v` as above (container `tapstate-mongo-rs-tls`).
