# Generate a throwaway self-signed TLS chain for the local development MongoDB.
#
# Store TLS is opt-in; this chain is used only when the store URI asks for it (ssl=true), letting the
# local replica-set speak TLS for that case. This produces a
# single self-signed certificate (CN=localhost, SAN localhost/127.0.0.1) valid for ten years:
#   ca.pem      the certificate, trusted by the client via tapstate.store.mongo.tls-ca-file
#   server.pem  the private key concatenated with the certificate, presented by mongod
#
# The generated files are git-ignored (see .gitignore) — a private key never belongs in the repo.
# Run this once before `docker compose -f ../docker-compose.tls.yml up`. Development only.
