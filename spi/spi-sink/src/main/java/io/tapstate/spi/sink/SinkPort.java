 *
 * <p>Opening a writer binds the port to a resolved {@link SinkConfig} and yields a {@link SinkWriter}
 * that holds the target resource across many batches. Writes are asynchronous — the port defines the
 * shape of delivery, not its pacing: how many writes are in flight, and the backpressure that bounds
 * them, are the runtime's concern, not the port's.
