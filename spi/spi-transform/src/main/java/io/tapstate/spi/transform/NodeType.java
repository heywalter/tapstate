 * The kinds of transform node a pipeline can carry. A closed set of six.

 * <p>Three are stateless and row-level — they implement the {@link TransformPort} seam directly:
 * {@link #FILTER}, {@link #MAP} and {@link #JS}. Three are not: {@link #UNION} merges many input
 * streams into one, and {@link #NEST} / {@link #JOIN} accumulate state across events. The three
 * non-row-level kinds reserve their names here; their execution contracts land with the execution
 * engine.
