/**
 * The read side of a connector: bounded snapshot reads, an unbounded CDC stream, a connection test
 * and schema discovery. A pure interface over the standard event envelope; it depends on the core
 * ring only (rule R2) and names no connector-specific type.
 *
 * <p>Read-side boundary: {@link #snapshot} yields snapshot reads (op {@code r}); {@link #cdc} yields
 * row and schema mutations (ops {@code i} / {@code u} / {@code d} / {@code ddl}). Where a stream
 * resumes from is not part of these signatures — resume position is the caller's concern, not the
 * port's.
 *
 * <p>How the two reads compose is driven by the pipeline read mode, read as a {@link CapturePlan}:
 * {@code snapshot_and_cdc} runs {@link #snapshot} then {@link #cdc}, {@code cdc_only} runs {@link #cdc}
 * alone, {@code snapshot_only} runs {@link #snapshot} alone. The two {@link CapturePhase}s classify
 * each yielded event by its op. At the snapshot → cdc hand-off the caller records the
 * {@link SourcePosition} the cdc phase resumes from and persists it (the resume position lives with the
 * caller, as above); the two phases are otherwise read through the same envelope stream.
