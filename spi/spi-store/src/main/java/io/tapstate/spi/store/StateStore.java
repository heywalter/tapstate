/**
 * The pipeline state store: persists one checkpoint per pipeline, whose transitions land only
 * through the epoch-fencing compare-and-swap. A pure interface over the checkpoint model in the
 * core ring (rule R2); it exposes the persistence surface only and does not define the state machine.
 *
 * <p>{@link #create} seeds a pipeline's first checkpoint at epoch 0 — the compare-and-swap cannot
 * bootstrap from an absent checkpoint. It is insert-only: it must not overwrite an existing
 * checkpoint, because doing so would reset the fencing epoch that {@link #compareAndSwap} maintains.
 * Seeding a pipeline that already has a checkpoint is a programmer / ordering error; a caller that
 * needs to know can {@link #read} first. It takes no epoch, so a seed is always epoch 0.
 *
 * <p>{@link #compareAndSwap} is the single legal transition write: it succeeds only when
 * {@code expectedEpoch} equals the stored epoch, incrementing the epoch on success and fencing any
 * stale writer otherwise, so two owners that both believe they hold the pipeline can never both
 * write. The state carrier is the opaque {@code stateJson}; the fencing decision is made on the
 * epoch alone, never on the state, so a lagging clock or a stale state view can never corrupt it.
