 * The durable SRS coordination store: one {@link SrsMeta} record per mining chain — the offset, consumer
 * cursor and schema truth that outlives the in-memory change ring. A pure interface over the store's own
 * value model (rule R2); a store backend persists it, and positions travel as opaque tokens, never as a
 * connector type.
 *
 * <p>{@link #create} seeds a chain's first record, carrying only the pass-through retention config. It is
 * insert-only: it must not overwrite an existing record, because doing so would discard the offset,
 * consumer-cursor and schema history the chain has accumulated. Seeding a chain that already has a record
 * is a caller ordering error; a caller that needs to know can {@link #read} first.
 *
 * <p>The mutators each update one facet of an already-seeded record — the source read offset, one
 * consumer's cursor, the cdc start position, or the schema history. A mutate on a chain that has not been
 * seeded is a caller ordering error, surfaced bare (an {@code IllegalStateException}), not laundered into
 * a coded diagnostic that would hide the defect. The durable-frontier bound on a source-read-offset
 * advance (an advance must not pass the slowest consumer's acked position) is the caller's concern; this
 * store persists the value the caller resolved.
