/**
 * The durable coordination record for one mining chain — the offset and schema truth that outlives the
 * in-memory change ring. A mining chain is the shared cdc capture keyed by physical source coordinates,
 * so one record serves every table and every consumer pipeline on that chain.
 *
 * <p>Fields — {@code miningChainId} (the chain this record is keyed by), {@code sourceReadOffset} (the
 * opaque source capture watermark the chain has read up to; absent until the first cdc read; its
 * durable advance is bounded by the slowest consumer's acked position), {@code consumerOffsets} (one
 * cursor per consumer pipeline), {@code cdcStartPosition} (the opaque position the cdc tail starts from,
 * recorded at the snapshot-to-cdc seam; absent until a snapshot seam or start point resolves it),
 * {@code schemaHistory} (the append-only versioned schema), and {@code retention} (the retention
 * configuration passed through from the source; a config value only — the change ring is bounded by
 * its capacity and backpressure, not trimmed by this).
 *
 * <p>The field set is append-only: a field may be added but never removed or repurposed, so an older
 * reader stays forward-compatible. The lists are unmodifiable defensive copies. A pure value over
 * {@code java..} only (rule R2): positions travel as opaque tokens, never as a connector type.
