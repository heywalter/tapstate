 * Ingests a connector artifact's bytes into the distribution store: it introspects the artifact for

 * registered under the same connector id, and otherwise register-if-absent stores it. The control ring
 * drives this port to serve the runtime register operation; its PDK-touching implementation lives in
 * the adapters ring. A pure interface (rule R2); it carries no connector-framework types.
 *
 * <p>The startup seed sweep reaches the same underlying ingestion by an on-disk path; this port is the
 * bytes-off-the-wire entry the register operation uses, since a remote CLI shares no filesystem with
 * the server.
