/**
 * The authentication and authorization gate on the {@code /api} verb surface. Every {@code /api} handler
 * is the projection of one registered operation (it carries {@link Verb}); before the handler runs, this
 * interceptor resolves that operation, authenticates the presented credential, and checks the credential's
 * grade against the operation's. Two coded refusals may result, each rendered as a structured body by the
 * shared exception advice:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code control.unauthenticated} (401)</b> — no credential was presented, or the one presented is
 *       malformed, unknown, revoked, expired or unsigned. The refusal is identical for every reason, so it
 *       cannot be used to probe which credentials exist.
 *   <li><b>{@code control.forbidden} (403)</b> — a known, authenticated caller lacks the grade the operation
 *       requires.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Registered on {@code /api/**} only, so it never sees the anonymous liveness probe or the
 * pre-authentication entry points (login, bootstrap) — those live outside {@code /api} by design. The
 * credential is read from an {@code Authorization: Bearer <credential>} header, where the credential is
 * either a machine token or a session token; {@link CredentialAuthenticator} routes it by shape.
