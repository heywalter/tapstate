/**
 * Marks an HTTP handler method as the projection of one control operation, naming its operation id. The
 * HTTP face composes registered operations; it never invents an endpoint. An architecture test reads
 * this annotation off every {@code /api} handler and asserts each value is a registered, CLI-exposed
 * operation — so the endpoint table stays a derivation of the registry rather than a hand-kept list.
 *
 * <p>Runtime-retained so the test can read it off the live handler mapping; it carries no behavior at
 * request time — dispatch does not consult it — so it adds no runtime reflection to serving a request.
