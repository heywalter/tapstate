/**
 * The pure log-tail delta a follower stream uses to send only what is new. The node-local sink is a
 * bounded ring: between polls it usually grew (an append) but may also have evicted old lines from the
 * front. Both windows are oldest-to-newest slices of the same append-only stream, so the new lines are
 * the current tail minus its overlap with what was already sent — the longest suffix of {@code previous}
 * that is a prefix of {@code current}. Everything after that overlap is new.
 *
 * <p>Anchoring on the overlap rather than on the last-sent line's last occurrence is what makes a repeated
 * message safe: if the last line sent recurs later in the window, its later copy is a genuinely new line,
 * not the boundary. When there is no overlap at all — a burst evicted the whole sent window — the entire
 * current tail is re-sent (re-tail), the honest behaviour for a bounded sink: a follower may see a line
 * twice, never lose one.
