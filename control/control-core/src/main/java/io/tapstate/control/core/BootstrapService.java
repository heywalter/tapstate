/**
 * The zero-user bootstrap exception: on a brand-new server whose user table is still empty, create the
 * one first admin so an operator has an account to sign in with, then close the exception for good. The
 * channel is guarded twice — the call must come from the loopback interface, and the user table must be
 * empty — and the created admin's creation is audited like any other user creation.
 *
 * <p>The two guards are checked in that order, and the order is load-bearing. A non-loopback caller is
 * refused ({@code control.bootstrap-forbidden}) before the store is even consulted, so a remote caller
 * gets the same answer whether or not the server has been bootstrapped and learns nothing about its
 * state. Only a trusted loopback caller ever reaches the emptiness check, and a non-empty table refuses
 * it with the distinct {@code control.bootstrap-closed}. There is no separate "channel open" flag: once
 * the first admin is saved the table is no longer empty, so every later call — even from loopback —
 * fails the emptiness guard. The service composes the user store, the password hasher and the audit
 * gate, each bound at the assembly root; the only state it holds is a single-flight guard.
 *
 * <p>The emptiness check and the create are one critical section: without that, two concurrent loopback
 * callers could both pass the check on a still-empty table and each create a different first admin. A
 * single-flight guard serializes the whole check-and-create so exactly one wins and every later caller
 * sees a non-empty table. The guard is per-instance and so covers one node — enough for the single-node
 * first landing; a multi-node deployment would additionally need an atomic insert-if-absent in the store.
