/**
 * Control core: the verb layer (apply / export / run / delete) and the single write entry.
 *
 * <p>Placeholder package reserving the module; the verbs and the desired-state writes are
 * added when the control layer lands. Rule R5: this module depends on core + the storage port,
 * stays framework-free (no Spring — Spring lives in rest-api, the HTTP face), and reaches the
 * runtime only through the store — save the synchronous probe whitelist (a closed set of two),
 * the sole compile reference it holds into the runtime ring.
