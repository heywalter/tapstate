/**
 * The capability check every operation dispatch passes: an authenticated credential may invoke an
 * operation only when its grade is at least the grade the operation requires. A credential that falls
 * short is refused with the coded {@code control.forbidden} diagnostic — the caller is known (already
 * authenticated), they simply lack the grade, so this is distinct from an authentication failure and
 * may name the operation and the grade it needs.
 *
 * <p>Pure logic with no dependencies: the grade order lives on {@link Scope#permits(Scope)}, and the
 * refusal is a coded control-domain error. The dispatcher wires this in after authentication and
 * before the audit gate, so an under-privileged caller never reaches an audited effect.
