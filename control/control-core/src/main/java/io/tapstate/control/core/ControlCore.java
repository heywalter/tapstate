 * apply / export / run / delete verbs are implemented here later. Rule R5: depends on core +
 * the storage port, stays framework-free (no Spring — Spring lives in rest-api), and reaches the
 * runtime only through the store — the one exception being the synchronous connection-probe
 * whitelist (a closed set of two), the sole compile reference it holds into the runtime ring.
