/**
 * The surface-facing report of a connector registration: the control ring's own projection of the
 * storage-port {@link RegistrationOutcome}, so the HTTP and CLI faces render a control-ring type and
 * never reach into the storage ports. It carries the registered connector's identity — id, content
 * hash, declared PDK API version (null when the artifact declares none) and the recorded source — and
 * {@code newlyRegistered}: false when the identical artifact was already registered and this call was a
 * no-op. On that no-op branch the identity is the artifact's first registration, so a caller reads
 * "already registered" from the flag rather than the source. An immutable value.
