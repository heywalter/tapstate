/**
 * The control plane's register verb: it ingests an uploaded connector artifact into the distribution
 * store through the registrar port, and returns what was registered. The whole operation runs under the
 * audit gate — registering executable connector code is an audited write, so an audit record is written
 * before the artifact is ingested and the operation is refused if that write fails (no audit, no
 * execute).
 *
 * <p>The audited resource is the artifact, keyed by its content hash: it identifies exactly the bytes
 * being registered and is computed here without classloading, so the record is written before the
 * registrar opens the artifact at all. The registrar refuses an artifact that does not load, declares no
 * identity, or collides with a different artifact already registered under its id — those coded
 * connector-domain failures propagate out of here uncaught. The stored outcome keeps the storage-port
 * shape; the returned report is the control ring's own projection, so the faces never reach into the
 * storage ports.
