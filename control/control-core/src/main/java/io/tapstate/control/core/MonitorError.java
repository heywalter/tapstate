/**
 * The {@code monitor} domain's error codes: user-facing, diagnosable failures of a store-backed
 * observation read — a status / metrics / snapshot read of a pipeline whose observation document has
 * not been published — carried through the error-code system and rendered through the shared message
 * catalog. The read also serves frontends with no stderr/exit channel, so a missing observation is a
 * coded diagnostic, not a bare usage error.
 *
 * <p>{@code placeholders()} is the named-argument contract: every throw site supplies a value for
 * each name, and the build-time placeholder gate checks the catalog templates against it.
