/**
 * The metrics read face: a pipeline's open map of numeric run statistics ({@code name -> value}) plus its
 * per-table source positions ({@code table -> opaque srcpos}). The field set is deliberately not fixed —
 * adding a metric is a map entry, not a contract-shape change. Positions ride in their own map rather than
 * the numeric one because a srcpos (binlog/GTID/LSN) is an opaque String, not a count; a read face presents
 * the two together. Either map is empty when its source is not wired yet (unavailable), never faked.
