 * The pipeline logs read side. It tails the node-local log sink for one pipeline — the process's own
 * captured log output, keyed by pipeline id. This is the read face that is not store-backed: it reads
 * an in-process sink directly rather than the published observation doc, because logs are node-local
 * and not fanned into a shared store. A read of a pipeline with no captured lines is a benign empty
 * tail, never a coded error.
