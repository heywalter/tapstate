/**
 * The canonical set of control operations, declared as code constants (no classpath or reflection
 * scanning). This is the single source of truth from which every face derives its surface, and the
 * seed an {@link OperationRegistry} is built over.
 *
 * <p>The first landing opens only the subset it needs, and only on the CLI face at {@code POC} — no
 * operation carries an {@code MCP} or {@code REST} exposure key yet, so those faces derive empty.
 * Later slices append their own domains (task, connector, runtime read) here, so every face grows
 * the new verbs in lockstep rather than each face maintaining its own hand-written list.
 *
 * <p>The audit flag marks the operations that mutate persisted control-plane state (an artifact, a
 * connection's persisted probe or discovery result, a user, a token) and therefore leave a record;
 * read and list operations carry no audit flag.
