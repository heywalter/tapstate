/**
 * Serializes the derived capability bitmap — connector id to the capability ids its
 * {@code registerCapabilities} registered — to the transient text the PDK-free assembler reads back.
 * One tab-separated line per connector: the id followed by its sorted capability ids. Line-oriented
 * so neither tool needs a JSON library at the hand-off; ids sorted so a refresh diff is stable. The
 * bitmap is transient (not checked in), so it is not byte-locked; the determinism is for legibility.
 * A connector that registered nothing is a line with just its id.
