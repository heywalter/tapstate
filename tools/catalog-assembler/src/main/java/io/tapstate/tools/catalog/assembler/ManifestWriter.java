/**
 * Builds the probe manifest the PDK-free assembler hands to catalog-derive: the worklist of Java
 * connectors derive must classload to read their capability bitmap. Each line is
 * {@code id\tmodule\tclass} — the id (the bitmap key), the module (so derive resolves the built dist
 * jar) and the fully-qualified connector class (what derive classloads). A line-oriented hand-off
 * keeps derive dependency-free: it parses with a split, no JSON library. JavaScript connectors have
 * no class and are omitted. Lines are sorted by id with the same comparator the walk and assembler
 * use, so the file is deterministic. The shape is the contract between the two tools; catalog-derive
 * reads these same fields.
