/**
 * The accounting of one catalog assembly run: what was ingested and every degradation that must be
 * visible rather than silent — connectors with no resolvable mode (unclassified), Java connectors
 * whose capabilities could not be derived this refresh because their jar was not built or would not
 * classload (not derived), message-queue connectors derived as cdc because they declare no
 * {@code tapstate.modes} (mq suspects), sinks whose write semantics were defaulted with no DML signal,
 * unrecognized Formily type tokens and unresolved i18n label refs, plus the modules the walk set
 * aside. Checked in beside the catalog so every gap is reviewable in the PR.
