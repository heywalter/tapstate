/**
 * The per-pipeline desired intent: one doc per pipeline stating the target state a user asked the
 * pipeline to reach, at the artifact revision that intent was expressed against. This is the desired
 * half of the split; the actual half is the epoch-fenced {@link CheckpointDoc}. Desired is plain
 * intent, written by the control side and never epoch-fenced; the converge side reads it and drives
 * the actual state toward it. The shape is an external contract — adding a field is backward
 * compatible, changing or removing one is a breaking change. The real Mongo serialization lives in an
 * adapter; this record is the shape.
