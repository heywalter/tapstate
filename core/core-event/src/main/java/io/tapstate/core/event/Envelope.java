/**
 * The standard event envelope: one change event as every transform sees it, the common currency of
 * the capture, transform and sink ports. An immutable value.
 *
 * <p>Seven slots — {@code op} (the change kind), {@code ts} (event time as epoch milliseconds),
 * {@code src} (the logical stream name the event came from), three data maps {@code before} /
 * {@code after} / {@code schema}, and {@code srcPos} (the source position the event was captured at).
 * Which data maps are present follows the op: insert and read carry {@code after}, delete carries
 * {@code before}, update carries both, ddl carries {@code schema} and neither row. An absent map is
 * {@code null}; the {@link #insert} / {@link #update} / {@link #delete} / {@link #read} / {@link #ddl}
 * factory methods encode the per-op shape by construction.
 *
 * <p>{@code srcPos} is a nullable opaque token — never a connector object — marking where in the
 * source change stream the event sits; it is what the sink acks back so the durable source-read
 * frontier never passes an unacked change. It is set only where a position exists: a cdc change
 * projected from the change ring carries it, while a snapshot read, a synthetic event and any event
 * built by a transform port carry {@code null}. A transform port is a pure function and never sets it;
 * the runtime stamps the inbound position onto a port's outputs via {@link #withSrcPos}. The six-arg
 * factories and constructor leave it {@code null} by construction.
 *
 * <p>The data maps are held as shallow-unmodifiable defensive copies: the map itself cannot be
 * mutated and a later mutation of the caller's map does not leak in, but nested values are shared.
