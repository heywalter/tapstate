 * Pipeline read mode: what a pipeline consumes along the snapshot × change-tail axis. It is a
 * pipeline-level setting, not a source property — one shared source may be read three different ways
 * by three pipelines. It only distinguishes behaviour for {@code cdc} sources; for bounded
 * ({@code snapshot}/{@code file}/{@code api}) and pure-stream sources it is a no-op, except that
 * {@code snapshot_only} over a pure {@code stream} source is a validate-layer error.
