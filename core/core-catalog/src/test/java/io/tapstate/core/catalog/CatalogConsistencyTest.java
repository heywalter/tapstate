/**
 * Validates the real bundled catalog the build tool generated into main resources — the artifact the
 * runtime ships. This runs in every build (no connectors checkout, no PDK), so it is the always-on
 * guard that the checked-in catalog is internally consistent: the index and the per-connector entries
 * agree, every entry reconstructs, and the well-known connectors are present. A broken or empty
 * regeneration fails here. Assertions are by floor and by known id, not by exact count, so adding a
 * connector does not break this test.
