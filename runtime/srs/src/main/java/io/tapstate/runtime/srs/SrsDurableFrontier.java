/**
 * The durable-frontier bound on a source-read-offset advance. The in-memory change ring is volatile —
 * after a restart it is gone and the only durable landing for a change is the idempotent sink. So the
 * persisted source read offset must never pass the slowest consumer's sink-acked source position: every
 * change ahead of the offset must stay re-minable from the source, or a change that was only ever in the
 * ring and had not yet reached a sink would be lost.
 *
 * <p>This resolves the safe offset to persist — the reader's candidate clamped so it never passes the
 * minimum sink-acked position across all consumers. It is empty (advance nothing) when no consumer holds
 * the data durably yet: when there are no consumers, or when any consumer has acked nothing (its frontier
 * sits below the origin and pins the whole advance).
 *
 * <p>A source position is an opaque token whose order is connector-defined; this never parses the token,
 * it ranks positions only through the injected {@code positionOrder}.
