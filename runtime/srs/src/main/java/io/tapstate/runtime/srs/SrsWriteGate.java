/**
 * The headroom guard on writes into one per-table change ring. A cdc write is admitted only when it would
 * not overwrite a change the slowest consumer has not read yet; otherwise it is backpressured — refused,
 * so the source read pauses until a consumer advances and frees a slot, never silently dropping an unread
 * change. This is the application-layer overflow control the ring itself does not do: the ring only writes
 * and reports its bounds.
 *
 * <p>The precheck compares the sequence the next write would take, {@code tailSeq + 1}, against the
 * slowest consumer's read cursor — a write is refused when {@code (tailSeq + 1) - minConsumerReadSeq >
 * capacity}, i.e. it would evict a sequence no consumer has read. {@code minConsumerReadSeq} is the
 * minimum last-read sequence across the ring's consumers ({@code -1} when a consumer has read nothing);
 * pass {@link Long#MAX_VALUE} when no consumer constrains the ring.
