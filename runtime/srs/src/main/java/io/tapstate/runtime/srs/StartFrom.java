/**
 * Where a pipeline starts consuming a mining chain's incremental tail — the typed reading of its
 * {@code start_from} setting. Three forms: {@link Earliest} replays every change still buffered,
 * {@link Latest} takes only changes from now on, and {@link At} starts from the first change at or after
 * an instant. It positions this one pipeline's consumer cursor into the change ring; it never moves the
 * shared mining chain's own read offset.
 *
 * <p>The authoring layer holds {@code start_from} as a free string and does not constrain its format, so
 * an unrecognized value is caught here at consumption time rather than by the validate layer.
 *
 * <p>It is {@link Serializable}: parsed once at pipeline assembly, it is captured by the Jet source's
 * create function and shipped to the member that resolves it against the ring there.
