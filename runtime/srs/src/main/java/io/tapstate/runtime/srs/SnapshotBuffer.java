/**
 * A member-local buffer that carries one source's bounded snapshot rows from the capture side to the source
 * vertex, keyed by the per-table change ring the source reads. The capture side appends every snapshot row
 * for a ring; the source vertex drains them once and emits them ahead of the ring's cdc tail. That ordering
 * is the data-consistency guarantee: a snapshot row (the older value) must reach the sink before any cdc
 * change of the same key, or a stale snapshot would overwrite a newer change.
 *
 * <p>It is plain member-local state, never a distributed structure: there is one embedded member per process,
 * the capture side that writes and the source vertex that reads run in that one process, and a snapshot row
 * carries no source position, so it never needs to survive a member restart the way the cdc ring's durable
 * source offset does. Both sides may touch it concurrently, so it is backed by concurrent maps and queues.
 *
 * <p>A drain is once-consumed: it removes a ring's rows and returns them, so a second drain of the same ring
 * yields nothing. That matches how the source vertex resolves the buffer exactly once when it initializes.
