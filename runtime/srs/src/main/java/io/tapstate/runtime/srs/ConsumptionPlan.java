/**
 * How a pipeline consumes a source, branched from its read mode and its source's {@code srs.enabled} flag.
 * It extends the read-mode-only {@link CapturePlan} (which decides the snapshot / cdc phases) with the SRS
 * dimension: when there is an incremental tail, whether it flows through the shared replay ring or straight
 * to the single consumer.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code snapshot} — run the bounded snapshot phase (pass its rows straight to the sink);</li>
 *   <li>{@code tail} — attach the unbounded incremental tail;</li>
 *   <li>{@code sharedRing} — the tail flows through the shared per-table replay ring, and this pipeline
 *       registers its own consumer cursor on the mining chain; when false with a tail, the tail streams
 *       straight to this one consumer with no shared buffering (the {@code srs.enabled: false} path).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only a shared-ring tail registers a consumer cursor: a snapshot-only read has no tail, and a direct
 * tail has no shared ring to position a cursor into. {@code srs.enabled} is immaterial without a tail.
