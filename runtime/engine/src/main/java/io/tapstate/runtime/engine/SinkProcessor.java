/**
 * Drives a {@link SinkWriter} from a Jet vertex: it batches inbound events, keeps a bounded number of
 * writes in flight, and completes only once every write has settled. The write side of the contract
 * hands pacing to the runtime, and this is where it lives — batching, the in-flight bound, and the
 * backpressure it produces are all here, while the writer stays a pure delivery contract. One adapter
 * serves every sink; the write mode and ddl policy fold into the writer the factory opens, not here.
 *
 * <p>Backpressure is by refusal: when the in-flight bound is reached the processor stops draining its
 * inbox, so Jet holds the upstream back until an outstanding write settles and frees a slot. A batch's
 * events are handed to the writer and never touched again, honouring the writer's ownership window.
 *
 * <p>The vertex runs at total parallelism one and, by default, keeps a single write in flight: one
 * {@code serve.sync} is one external target, and applying one batch to completion before the next is
 * issued is what keeps a key's change events in their arrival order. Two batches that straddle a key
 * (an insert last in one, its update first in the next) would otherwise be free to apply out of order,
 * since the writer runs them off the caller's thread with no ordering of its own — the contract hands
 * in-flight ordering to the runtime, and this is where the runtime keeps it. Raising the in-flight
 * bound pipelines writes for throughput and is therefore only for a sink whose target applies writes
 * order-independently or is append-only; it is not the default. Snapshotting is not implemented: the
 * durable offset is the source's, not Jet's, so a restart replays from the source rather than
 * resuming a sink snapshot.
