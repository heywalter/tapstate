/**

 * job operations. A pipeline runs as exactly one Jet job named by the pipeline id, so the actuator
 * can find that job again to suspend / resume / cancel it. The topology (the {@link DAG}) is built
 * elsewhere and handed in; this engine only submits and controls the job.
 *
 * <p>Jet is a subordinate execution layer, not the source of truth: jobs carry no durable offset
 * snapshot ({@link ProcessingGuarantee#NONE}) and may be discarded and re-submitted at any time.
 * Continuation truth lives in the store, so a resumed job re-reads its start position from there
 * rather than from a Jet snapshot. Rule R4: this depends on the kernel and Hazelcast only.
