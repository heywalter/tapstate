 * so it advances {@code (chain, position)} and leaves the rest to the binding: the assembly root wires an
 * implementation that maps the stream to its mining chain and pipeline and writes the durable store.
 *
 * <p>{@link Serializable} so it can travel on the DAG to the member that runs the sink, carrying only the
 * coordinates it needs and resolving the store member-side, the same way the source's read-cursor
 * publisher does — the durable store itself never crosses the wire.
