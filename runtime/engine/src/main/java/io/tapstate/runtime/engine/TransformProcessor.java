/**
 * Wraps a stateless {@link TransformPort} into a Jet processor: for each inbound {@link Envelope} it
 * emits every envelope the port returns — the one event a map keeps, none for a filtered drop, or
 * the several of a fan-out. One adapter serves the whole stateless family (map / filter / a scripted
 * row transform); each is only a different pure function behind the same seam.
 *
 * <p>Carrying the source position across the transform is the adapter's concern, not the port's: the
 * port is a pure function that never sets a position, so the adapter stamps the inbound event's
 * position onto every event the port returns. A fan-out's several outputs all share the one inbound
 * position; its completion is the sink's concern (every output must settle before the position is
 * acked). An inbound event with no position stamps none.
 *
 * <p>Emit-side backpressure is the adapter's concern too: the flat mapper resumes a partially emitted
 * event when the outbox is full, so the port stays a pure function that does not pace itself.
 *
 * <p>The vertex runs at total parallelism one: a sink downstream acks an ordered position stream, and
 * a parallelism-greater-than-one transform would re-lane events and break that order.
