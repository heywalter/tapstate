/**
 * The runtime-side schema-discovery probe: it fulfils the synchronous control-to-runtime seam by
 * driving the connector-plane schema-discoverer port and returning its normalized model. The
 * discoverer implementation — the one that opens the connector through the PDK — is injected by the
 * app assembly root, so the runtime ring never compiles against an adapter. In the first landing this
 * delegation is a direct in-process call; when the control and runtime roles split, this probe is the
 * engine-side handler the control plane reaches across instances.
