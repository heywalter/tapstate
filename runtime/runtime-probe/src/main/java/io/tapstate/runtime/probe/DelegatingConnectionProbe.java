/**
 * The runtime-side connection probe: it fulfils the synchronous control-to-runtime seam by driving the
 * connector-plane connection-tester port and returning its normalized result. The tester implementation
 * — the one that opens the connector through the PDK — is injected by the app assembly root, so the
 * runtime ring never compiles against an adapter. In the first landing this delegation is a direct
 * in-process call; when the control and runtime roles split, this probe is the engine-side handler the
 * control plane reaches across instances.
