/**
 * Publishes a pipeline's observation from its converged actual state: it reads the fenced checkpoint,
 * maps the wire-form state back to the lifecycle state, and writes the latest observation projection to
 * the observation store. This is the runtime side of the store-backed observation contract — the runtime
 * writes the observation, control reads it, and the two meet only at the store, never calling each other.
 * A pipeline with no checkpoint yet has nothing to observe and is left untouched (no empty doc is written).
 *
 * <p>The errorCount metric has two sources. On a converged pass it is derived from that same actual state —
 * 1 while the pipeline is FAILED, 0 otherwise — so a dead data-plane job is an observable statistic, not just
 * a log line. When a reconcile pass instead keeps throwing (its store is unreachable, so it never converges),
 * {@link #publishReconcileFailure} carries the consecutive-failure count as errorCount so the pipeline is
 * observable as broken rather than silently absent from the read face. Either way errorCount &gt; 0 means the
 * pipeline is unhealthy. recordCount and the per-table sink-acked positions come from injected sources: the
 * record count rides the numeric metrics map when a live job reports one and is absent otherwise, and the
 * positions ride their own String-valued map. A missing metric or position means its source is not wired,
 * expressed by absence rather than a sentinel; the snapshot dataset is likewise unavailable and published
 * empty (never faked). Republishing overwrites the latest projection in place — the observation is
 * current-state, not a time series, so the derived errorCount tracks the state and does not accumulate across
 * ticks (a recovered pipeline drops back to 0).
