 * Turns a converged lifecycle transition into the matching data-plane job operation. The converge

 * the execution engine. Kept an interface so the converge loop stays free of the engine and its
 * framework — the data-plane binding is wired in at assembly and the loop is unit-tested against a
 * recording double.
 *
 * <p>Each verb is named by the pipeline id alone: the actuator owns the mapping from a pipeline to its
 * job and, for a start, the topology that job runs. Start begins a fresh run; resume continues a
 * paused one; pause holds a running one; stop ends it. All four are the job side only — the
 * pipeline-private continuation the source store holds is cleared elsewhere.
