/**
 * The face-projection gates: the HTTP endpoint table must stay a derivation of the operation registry,
 * in both directions. The registry is the single source of truth for what the process can do; a face
 * composes registered operations and never invents one, and an operation the registry opens on a face
 * must actually be reachable there.
 *
 * <p>This is the gate the {@link Verb} annotation is declared for. It lives here rather than in a
 * face test because only a whole-module scan sees every handler at once: a Spring test stands up the
 * controllers it names, so it can only ever assert the slice it booted — which is what let an operation
 * the registry declares open sit with no endpoint at all, unnoticed.
 *
 * <p>Scanning reuses arch-tests' existing capability (ArchUnit's {@code ClassFileImporter}, production
 * scope only) — no second scanning library, and no application context.
