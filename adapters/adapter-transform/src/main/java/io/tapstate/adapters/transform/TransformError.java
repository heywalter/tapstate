/**
 * The {@code transform} domain's error codes: the first-party, diagnosable failures a stateless row
 * transform raises while it evaluates an author's expression or script. These are user-facing — the
 * author wrote a CEL expression that fails against the row it meets, or a js script that will not
 * compile, defines no entry point, throws at runtime, or produces output that is not a record.
 *
 * <p>Two-segment {@code transform.<symbol>} codes; they go through the full build-time gate set like
 * any other first-party domain. Programmer errors / invariant violations stay bare and are allowed to
 * crash — a checked AST that will not build into a program, for instance, is not laundered into a
 * {@code transform.*} code that would hide the defect. {@code placeholders()} is the named-argument
 * contract: every throw site supplies a value for each name, and the build-time placeholder gate
 * checks the catalog templates against it.
