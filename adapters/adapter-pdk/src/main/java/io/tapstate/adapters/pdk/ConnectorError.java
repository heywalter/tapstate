/**
 * The {@code connector} domain's error codes: the first-party, diagnosable failures the PDK bridge
 * raises when it loads, level-gates, drives or projects a connector. These are user-facing — the
 * operator pointed the bridge at a connector jar that will not load, declared a class that is not a
 * connector, requires a newer PDK API than the bridge provides, or produced an event the codec could
 * not project.
 *
 * <p>These are two-segment {@code connector.<symbol>} codes and go through the full build-time gate
 * set like any other first-party domain. They are deliberately distinct from the reserved
 * {@code connector.<connector-id>.<symbol>} namespace a connector's OWN thrown codes occupy: those
 * carry a connector-id segment, are longer by construction, and are deduped at runtime rather than at
 * build time (they come from jars the build cannot see).
 *
 * <p>Programmer errors / invariant violations stay bare and are allowed to crash — they are not
 * laundered into a {@code connector.*} code that would hide the defect. {@code placeholders()} is the
 * named-argument contract: every throw site supplies a value for each name, and the build-time
 * placeholder gate checks the catalog templates against it.
