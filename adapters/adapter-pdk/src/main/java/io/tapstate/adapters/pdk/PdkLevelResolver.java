/**
 * Judges whether a connector may be loaded by resolving its declared PDK API-level requirement
 * against the level this bridge provides. A pure four-state decision: compatible, incompatible, a
 * version the registry does not recognize, or nothing declared. It only judges — refusing a connector
 * and rendering the coded, actionable diagnosis is the load path's job; this resolver stays free of
 * the error-code system so it is a plain, testable function.
 *
 * <p>A connector expresses its requirement as a PDK API version and/or an already-derived level, the
 * two reserved slots a catalog entry carries. An explicit level is authoritative and wins over the
 * version; otherwise the version resolves to a level through the Tapstate-side registry, and a version
 * with no row resolves to {@link LevelOutcome#UNKNOWN_VERSION} rather than crashing — operator data
 * gets a verdict, not a bare stack. Comparison is {@code required <= provided} — a newer requirement
 * is refused, never silently downgraded.
