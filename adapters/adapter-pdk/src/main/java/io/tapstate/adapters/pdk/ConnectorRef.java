 * dependencies), its entry class name, its declared PDK API compatibility — a version and/or an
 * already-derived level, either of which may be {@code null} — and its raw spec JSON, whose
 * {@code dataTypes} the bridge reads to map a discovered field's database type onto a PDK type before a
 * read. The spec may be {@code null} when it is not available or not needed (a synthetic connector).
 * Resolving a connector id to this ref (from the seed directory today, the distribution store later) is
 * a separate concern; the bridge only consumes the ref.
