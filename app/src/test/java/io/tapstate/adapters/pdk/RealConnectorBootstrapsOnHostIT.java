/**
 * The witness that a real Tapdata connector constructs on the assembly root's own runtime classpath.
 * A connector dist jar is a thin plugin whose base class bootstraps the PDK runtime (TapRuntime) through
 * the host class loader the moment it is instantiated; the host must therefore carry the runtime. This
 * drives the production open path — introspect the artifact, gate its API level, load and construct it —
 * against a real jar, from the deliverable module, on the same runtime dependency the shipped server
 * carries. (A test fork's classpath is a superset of the shipped one, so this alone does not prove the
 * runtime is packaged into the boot jar; a sibling guard on the packaged boot jar locks that separately.)
 * Constructing the connector needs no database: the runtime is bootstrapped at construction, before any
 * connect, so this stays a pure reachability witness.
 *
 * <p>It lives in the bridge's own package on purpose. The open path stops, database-free, at the
 * package-private {@code PdkConnector.open} — the exact seam a real connector reaches through, and the
 * one no test had ever driven with a real jar. Reaching it from the deliverable module (rather than
 * duplicating its logic) is why this test declares the bridge's package: the class it must call is
 * package-private, and on the flat classpath a same-package test can call it.
 *
 * <p>Gated on {@code -Dtapstate.pdk.it.jarA} (a second is optional via {@code -Dtapstate.pdk.it.jarB}), so
 * the default build — which carries no connector jars — skips it and stays green. Point it at a real
 * database connector dist:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   mvn -pl app verify \
 *     -Dtapstate.pdk.it.jarA=/path/mysql-connector.jar \
 *     -Dtapstate.pdk.it.jarB=/path/mongodb-connector.jar
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A thin plugin bundles neither the PDK runtime (provided on the host) nor, when they are not shaded
 * in, its own driver libraries. {@code -Dtapstate.pdk.it.runtimeCp} is an optional
 * {@link File#pathSeparator}-joined list of such extra libraries; it joins the isolated connector
 * loader's classpath, never the host's, and is not where the runtime comes from.
