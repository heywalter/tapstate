/**
 * Starting the embedded Hazelcast member can fail for operational reasons — most commonly the
 * loopback member port is already held by another server on the same host. That is a user-facing,
 * diagnosable startup failure, so it surfaces as a coded diagnostic (rendered by
 * {@code CodedFailureAnalyzer}) rather than a bare Hazelcast stack trace. A failure that is not
 * Hazelcast's — a programmer error while assembling the member — is not laundered into a code; it
 * crashes bare.
