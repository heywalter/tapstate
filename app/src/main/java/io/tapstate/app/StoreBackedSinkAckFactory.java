/**
 * The production sink-ack factory carried onto the DAG: it advances one consumer pipeline's durable
 * sink-acked source position as the sink confirms writes, so the source-read durable frontier has a real
 * input. It holds only serializable coordinates — a {@code table -> mining chain id} map for every source
 * the pipeline reads, plus the consumer pipeline id — and resolves the durable store on the member that
 * runs the sink, mirroring how the source's read-cursor publisher binds its store member-side. The store
 * itself is not serializable and never crosses the wire.
 *
 * <p>The sink knows a chain only by the {@code src} stream name its events carry — a table at L1 — so this
 * maps that stream to the mining chain that keys its durable record and advances
 * {@code (miningChainId, pipelineId, srcpos)}. A member with no store bound resolves to a no-op ack, so a
 * sink still runs before the assembly layer makes the member SRS-capable. A stream the map does not carry
 * is a builder-side wiring defect (the sink saw a chain the pipeline never sourced) and crashes bare.
