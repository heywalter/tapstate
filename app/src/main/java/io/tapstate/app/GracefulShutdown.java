/**
 * Owns process termination for the server. On SIGTERM/SIGINT the JVM runs the installed shutdown
 * hook, which stops the server in order (closing the application context — the embedded Hazelcast
 * member leaves, the store connection closes) and then forces exit code 0.
 *
 * <p>Why force the exit code: the JVM's default disposition for a signal-terminated run is
 * {@code 128 + signum} (143 for SIGTERM), even after shutdown hooks execute cleanly. An operator
 * asking the process to stop expects a clean {@code 0}. Calling {@code Runtime.halt(0)} from inside
 * the hook preempts that default disposition — {@code halt} is a standard, public API, so no
 * internal signal handling is needed.
 *
 * <p>The orderly stop and the halt are injected seams ({@code Runnable} + {@code IntConsumer}) so
 * the logic is unit-testable; production wires {@code context::close} and {@code Runtime.getRuntime()::halt}.
 * The real signal-to-exit-0 path is witnessed black-box by dist-smoke.
