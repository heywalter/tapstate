/**
 * Sweeps the connector seed directory once at startup and logs each artifact's fate. Failures are
 * per-artifact and already contained in the sweep's outcomes, so a defective seed jar is a warning
 * in the log, never a failed boot; what does register is exactly what the release shipped in the
 * directory. A seed path that is misconfigured (exists but is not a directory) or a directory the
 * process cannot list is deliberately not contained: that fault hides every shipped connector at
 * once, so it fails the boot loudly instead of degrading silently.
