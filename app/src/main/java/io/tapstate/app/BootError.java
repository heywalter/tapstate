/**
 * The {@code boot} domain's error codes: startup-fatal failures of the assembly root that are the
 * operator's to fix. Bringing the embedded Hazelcast member up can fail because its loopback port is
 * already held by another server on the same host — a user-facing, diagnosable failure carried
 * through the error-code system and rendered through the shared message catalog, not a bare stack.
 *
 * <p>{@code placeholders()} is the named-argument contract: every throw site supplies a value for
 * each name, and the build-time placeholder gate checks the catalog templates against it. This code
 * carries none on purpose — the underlying cause is attached to the exception (and logged), so the
 * operator-facing message stays a stable, detail-free diagnostic.
