#
# Dist smoke suite for the Tapstate server (L1 packaging slice).
#
# Verifies the single service deliverable shape as a black box: the Spring Boot fat-jar boots under
# --role=all, rejects an unsupported role with a coded diagnostic (non-zero exit), and the assembled
# dist tar.gz unpacks to bin/conf/lib whose launcher brings the same process up. A JVM unit test
# cannot catch a broken repackage, a missing dist file, or a launcher pointing at the wrong jar —
# only the produced artifacts can — so this script is the executable spec for service packaging (the
# JVM counterpart of the CLI's native-smoke.sh).
#
# "Boots" means: the application context starts, the process STAYS UP (the embedded Hazelcast
# member + Jet engine are the keep-alive plane), and SIGTERM brings it down cleanly — the member
# logs an orderly SHUTDOWN and the process exits 0. The server installs its own termination hook:
# it closes the context in order (member leaves, store closes) then forces exit 0, rather than the
# JVM's default disposition for a signal-terminated run (143 = 128+15).
#
# The store connection is disabled for the boot checks (--tapstate.store.mongo.enabled=false): this is
# a black-box test of packaging + operational logging, not of store connectivity (which has its own
# unit test and a testcontainers integration test), so it must not depend on a reachable replica-set.
#
# Usage:
#   app/dist-smoke.sh [--build]
#     --build   build the app artifacts first (mvn -pl app -am package -DskipTests)
#
# Exit 0 iff every check passes.
