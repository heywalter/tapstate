/**
 * The CLI's view of a connection's discovered source model: the tables the source exposes — each with
 * its fields, primary key and indexes — and when the model was discovered (epoch milliseconds). The
 * response-side value the {@code discover-schema} and {@code schema} verbs decode from the server's
 * JSON. The CLI carries no shared control type (rule R6: it reaches the server over HTTP only), so this
 * mirrors the server's report shape independently. A field {@code type} is the connector's own declared
 * type string, {@code null} when discovery could not resolve it — rendered rather than interpreted.
