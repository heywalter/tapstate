/**
 * The Tapstate CLI: the surface-ring product front-end. Dual-mode — bare {@code tapstate} opens the
 * offline REPL; one-shot subcommands share the same verb table for scripting / AI.
 *
 * <p>Offline verbs are a whitelist: {@code validate} / {@code new} / {@code explain} / {@code ls} /
 * {@code desc} run fully without any server. The server-state verbs are registered too, so they are
 * discoverable and report a coded "not connected" diagnostic rather than going missing; they reach a
 * service through the REPL, where a connection is established and held — the CLI talks to a running
 * Tapstate over HTTP only (rule R6).
