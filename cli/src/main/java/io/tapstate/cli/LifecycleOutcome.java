/**
 * The outcome of a remote pipeline lifecycle verb ({@code POST /api/pipelines/{id}:{verb}}). Either the
 * verb was accepted and the server reported the pipeline's new desired state (a target state at a
 * revision), or it was refused with a coded reason (an unknown pipeline, a transition the state machine
 * forbids, or a start/resume at a stale revision), or the server could not be reached. Sealed so the caller
 * renders each branch without try/catch, mirroring the never-throw transport seam. The CLI carries no
 * shared control type (rule R6: it reaches the server over HTTP only), so this mirrors the server's
 * desired-state shape independently.
